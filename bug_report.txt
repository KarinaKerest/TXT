Title: Unable to login

Description: I am unable to login to the application using my correct credentials. After entering my username and password, the login page just reloads without any error message or indication that I have logged in. This issue is occurring consistently and preventing me from using the application.

Steps to reproduce:

Navigate to the login page
Enter username and password
Click on the login button
Page reloads without logging me in
Expected result: After entering my correct credentials and clicking on the login button, I should be taken to the main page of the application and be logged in.

Actual result: The page just reloads without logging me in, with no error message or indication that I have logged in.
